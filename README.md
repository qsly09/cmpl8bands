This page is to illustrate the alignment of Landsat 8 Cirrus Band and Optical Bands (e.g., Red, Green, and Blue) for clouds. There are a total of 12 examples. We randomly selected them from the Landsat 8 data with cloud cover > 50% over the word (random dates and random locations) (Figure 1); and for each image we showed the central subset with 1241 pixels X 584 pixels (to fit the size of the commonly used screen). We observed most of clouds (including cirrus clouds and non-cirrus clouds) have very slight (and even none) displacements between different bands.
